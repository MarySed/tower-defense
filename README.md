# Cactus Tower Defense
2D, side-scrolling Tower Defense game built with C# and Unity in ~4 days. Completed for "polyglottal week" in which Code Chrysalis students learn a new language in less than 5 days. 

This was my first time using both Unity and C#. 

Play the game [here](https://marysed.github.io/tower-defense/)!

## Instructions

Cactus Tower Defense is a 2D point-and-click tower defense game. The "trophies" (floating potions) give you resources, and the cactus defenders attack enemies. If 3 enemies make it past your defenses, you lose (and some sad music plays).
